When it comes to diagnosing Pneumonia, chest X-rays are generally the way to go. They are quick, easy, and accessible almost anywhere. In this project we will be using a convolutional neural network to classify chest X-ray images into two classes, healthy and infected patients. 

The dataset we used is from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
5216 training images, 3875 instances of pneumonia and 1341 instances of healthy lungs
624 testing images, 390 instances of pneumonia and 234 instances of healthy lungs
16 validation images, 8 of each class

First model
Second model - subset of training
Second model on entire training set - did well

Transfer learning 

(---display number of epochs and scores---) for the readme??
---display confusion matrix----

----display summary table of model---
